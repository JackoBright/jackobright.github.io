            <p>I am a Full Stack Developer with experience in web application development and IT consulting. I love learning new skills, and as an IT technician, I have become skilled at learning new technologies and processes. I'm an Eagle Scout and am very driven to make a difference, both for the clients that use the applications I develop, and for communities at large.

                I recently graduated from Oregon State University with a B.S. in Computer Science. I chose a focus area of Game Simulation and Programming; these additional classes allowed me to gain experience in computer graphics and physics simulations, as well as game design and virtual reality development. I also pursued a Baccalaureate core, so I have extra perspective in global issues and considerations.
                
                I am looking forward to getting my first full-time position as a software engineer and to focus my passion into my work.</p>
